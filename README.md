Being provided with the data, we ahd to cleanse the data thas was given to be able to make better predictions.

**Methods**

All of the missing values in the Item Weight column was imputed with the average mean of the total values. Reason to fill in with the average of the provided data was so taht we could provide a more accurate model prediction.

When it came to our Outlet Size column, we filled all of our missing values with the previous rows values.
